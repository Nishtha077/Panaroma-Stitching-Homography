# Panoramic Image Stitching Project

## Overview
This project involves creating seamless panoramic images by stitching together multiple overlapping images. The process uses advanced feature detection, matching, and homography estimation techniques to align and blend images into a coherent panorama.

## Implementation Phases

### 1. Initial Implementation
The project started with the implementation of a basic panoramic stitching algorithm:
- **Feature Detection**: ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm was used to identify keypoints and compute their descriptors.
- **Homography Estimation**: RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) was used to robustly estimate the homography matrix for aligning images.

### 2. Techniques Explored
To enhance the performance and quality of the panorama, several advanced techniques were explored:

#### a. **SIFT + DoG**
- Replaced ORB with SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for more effective feature detection.
- Used the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) approach to capture features at multiple scales.
- Enhanced performance in varying lighting conditions.

#### b. **FAST + Harris**
- Integrated FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) for rapid feature detection.
- Combined with the Harris corner detector to assess the quality of detected features.
- Achieved a balance between speed and robustness.

#### c. **SIFT + Patch Descriptor**
- Enhanced SIFT's feature representation by incorporating patch descriptors.
- Extracted local patches around keypoints to capture more contextual information.
- Improved the reliability of feature matching.

#### d. **SIFT + Patch Descriptor + NNDR**
- Implemented NNDR (Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio) to refine the matching process.
- Ensured each feature matched its nearest neighbor, reducing false matches.
- Significantly improved matching quality.

#### e. **Geometric Minimization on Homography by RANSAC**
- Applied geometric minimization techniques to optimize the homography matrix estimated by RANSAC.
- Focused on reducing alignment errors for a seamless panorama.

## Key Features
- Multi-scale and robust feature detection.
- Advanced feature matching techniques to minimize false positives.
- Optimized homography estimation for accurate image alignment.
- Iterative improvements to enhance speed, accuracy, and visual quality.

## Results
The final implementation produces high-quality panoramic images with minimal artifacts and smooth transitions between the stitched images.

## Future Work
- Implement advanced blending techniques to further smooth seams.
- Experiment with deep learning models like SuperGlue for feature matching.
- Explore real-time panoramic stitching applications.
